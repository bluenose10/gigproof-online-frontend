# GigProof

GigProof is a Chrome extension and web app that helps gig workers generate a personal income summary PDF from earnings visible on Uber and DoorDash dashboards. The PDF is generated client-side and includes compliance language stating it is user-generated and not verified.

## Core Problem Solved
Gig workers need a clean, professional way to summarize earnings for landlords, lenders, and agencies without sharing bank logins or handing over screenshots.

## Core Features
- **Chrome Extension Extraction**: Reads only on-screen earnings totals from supported gig dashboards.
- **Client-Side PDF Generation**: Creates the PDF locally in the browser.
- **No Bank Connections**: No Plaid, no Open Banking, no financial account access.
- **Privacy-First**: No credential storage and no server-side earnings storage.

## Use Cases
- **Apartment Applications**: Provide a clear income summary.
- **Loan Applications**: Share a professional earnings report.
- **General Proof of Income**: Use for any third-party verification request.

## Supported Platforms
- Uber driver dashboard
- DoorDash driver dashboard
