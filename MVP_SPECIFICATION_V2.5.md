# GigProof MVP Specification v2.5 (Production State - CORRECTED)

**Status**: ✅ LIVE IN PRODUCTION | **Date**: Jan 31, 2026 | **Version**: 1.0.6

---

## 1. Core Product Identity

**GigProof** is a browser-based Chrome extension that empowers gig economy workers to self-generate professional "Income Summary" documentation. It bridges the gap between disorganized app dashboards and landlord/lender requirements without acting as a regulated financial intermediary.

### 🌍 Global Strategy (The "Client-Side Model")

By extracting data from user-visible web dashboards within the client's browser, rather than integrating with banking APIs, GigProof operates outside the scope of Open Banking and similar financial data access frameworks.

**Key Benefits:**
- **US / UK / EU Supported**: Works anywhere the gig platform provides a web dashboard
- **10 Platforms Supported**: Comprehensive coverage across major gig platforms
- **No Regulatory Capital Required**: Avoided £40,000 UK FCA requirement by not using Plaid/Open Banking

---

## 2. Platform Support (10 PLATFORMS LIVE)

### ✅ CURRENTLY SUPPORTED PLATFORMS:

1. **Uber** (Global)
2. **DoorDash** (US/Global)

7. **Shipt** (US)
8. **Gopuff** (US)

10. **Just Eat** (UK/EU)

**Status:** All 10 platforms have extraction logic implemented and are live in production

---

## 3. Architecture Overview

### A. Chrome Extension (Manifest V3)
**Location:** `/extension/`

**Core Files:**
- `manifest.json` - Extension configuration
- `platforms.js` - Platform detection & extraction config (10 platforms)
- `content.js` - Dynamic extractor based on platform config
- `popup.html` - User interface (glassmorphism design)
- `auth-bridge.js` - Syncs authentication between website and extension
- `background.js` - Service worker for persistent sessions

**Status:** ✅ Approved on Chrome Web Store

### B. Website (React + Vite)
**Location:** `/website/`

**Directory Structure:**
```
/website/
  ├── public/         ← Static assets (images, fonts, favicon, etc.)
  ├── src/            ← React components, pages, contexts
  │   ├── components/
  │   ├── pages/
  │   ├── contexts/
  │   ├── App.jsx
  │   └── main.tsx
  ├── index.html      ← Entry point
  └── package.json    ← Dependencies
```

**Tech Stack:**
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling
- Supabase for authentication & database
- jsPDF for client-side PDF generation
- Tailwind CSS (Fintech Green theme)

**Key Pages:**
- Landing page (gigproof.online)
- Dashboard (authenticated users)
- Download page (PDF generation)
- Pricing page (credit purchase)
- For Lenders page (B2B landing)
- Legal pages (Terms, Privacy)
- **Blog section** (`/blog/`) - 11 SEO-optimized articles

**Deployment:**
- Platform: Netlify
- URL: https://gigproof.online
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Base directory: `website/`
- Publish directory: `dist`

### C. Backend (Node.js + Supabase)
**Location:** `/backend/` and `/supabase/`

**Components:**
- Stripe Checkout endpoints (Supabase Edge Functions)
- Payment verification webhooks
- User authentication via Supabase Auth
- Credit tracking system in PostgreSQL
- Database: PostgreSQL (via Supabase)

**Important:** No PDF generation on backend - all done client-side

---

## 4. Authentication & Payments

### 🔐 Authentication Flow

**Supabase Auth** manages user sessions across Website and Chrome Extension:

1. User signs up/logs in on website
2. **3 FREE credits automatically granted on signup**
3. Session token stored in Supabase
4. Chrome Extension detects session via `auth-bridge.js`
5. Token synced to extension's local storage
6. Seamless experience across both platforms

### 💳 Payment & Credits System

**Current State:** `PAYMENTS_ENABLED: true`

**Pricing Structure:**
- ✅ **3 FREE credits on signup** (automatic)
- ✅ **$2.99 for 1 additional PDF**
- ✅ **$19.99 for 10 PDFs** (bulk pricing, $1.99 per PDF)

**Credits Flow:**
1. User signs up → Receives 3 free credits
2. User generates PDF → 1 credit deducted
3. When credits = 0 → Purchase required
4. User selects package (1 PDF or 10 PDFs)
5. Redirected to Stripe Checkout
6. After successful payment:
   - Webhook updates Supabase
   - Credits added to user account
   - User can generate more PDFs

**Database Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  credits INTEGER DEFAULT 3,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**PDF Generation:**
- Client-side using jsPDF (no backend storage)
- Each generation costs 1 credit
- Preview available before credit deduction
- Download triggers credit deduction

---

## 5. PDF Specification (Compliance-First)

### 📄 The "Safe" PDF Design

**Critical Compliance Elements:**
- **Title:** "Personal Income Summary" (NEVER "Verification")
- **Disclaimer:** *"This document is a user-generated income summary provided for informational purposes only. GigProof does not verify, certify, audit, or guarantee..."*
- **Watermark:** "PREVIEW ONLY" before credit deduction (removed after generation)
- **Data Source Statement:** "Generated from user-visible earnings data across gig platforms"

**Why This Matters:**
Avoids classification as regulated consumer reporting or financial verification service under:
- Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)
- Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) regulations
- FCA regulations (UK)

---

## 6. User Journey (The "Trust" Flow)

### Step-by-Step Experience:

1. **Discovery** → User lands on gigproof.online
2. **Sign Up** → Creates account (Supabase Auth) → **Gets 3 free credits automatically**
3. **Install Extension** → Downloads from Chrome Web Store
4. **Log In to Platform** → User logs into any of 10 supported platforms
5. **Extract Data** → Extension detects platform, user clicks "Extract Earnings"
6. **Preview PDF** → User sees preview (watermarked if no credits)
7. **Generate PDF** → 
   - If credits available → PDF generated immediately (1 credit deducted)
   - If no credits → Prompted to purchase more
8. **Purchase More** (if needed) → Select package ($2.99 or $19.99) → Stripe checkout
9. **Download** → PDF downloaded after generation
10. **Use** → Submit to landlord/lender for income verification

**Key Insight:** 3 free credits allow users to test the product before buying

**2. Comment Hijacking Strategy (Secondary Focus)**
- **UberPeople.net forum:**
  - Username: Mark_GigProof
  - Status: Registered, profile complete
  - Strategy: Post helpful comments on income verification threads
  - Target: 3-5 strategic comments per week
  - Approach: Provide value first, mention GigProof naturally

- **Reddit:**
  - Username: ComprehensiveAd3891
  - Age: 5 years old (helps avoid spam filters)
  - Karma: 2 post / 8 comment (building up)
  - Strategy: Warm up with non-promotional comments first
  - Target subreddits: r/uberdrivers, r/doordash, r/gig_economy, r/lyft, r/instacart

**3. SEO Websites (Supporting)**
- **taxguidehq.com** - Tax guidance for gig workers

- **gigproof.online** - Product website with blog

**Known Issues:**
- Traffic dropped after 2 months (Google Sandbox effect)
- No backlinks yet
- Low domain authority (brand new sites)
- Competing with established giants (TurboTax, Uber, Everlance)

**3. Potential Paid Advertising (Not Yet Launched)**

- Google Search ads for income verification keywords
- Reddit promoted posts in relevant subreddits
- Estimated budget: $300/month for testing

### Marketing Priorities (Next 30 Days):
1. Monitor Miami article performance (geographic targeting test)
2. If Miami converts well, create articles for LA, NYC, Chicago, Houston
3. Execute comment hijacking plan on 5+ high-value forum threads
4. Build 10 quality backlinks from relevant sites (blog posts as link targets)
5. Target long-tail SEO keywords with specific pain points
6. Consider launching small paid ad test ($100-200)

## 9. Technical Decisions & Rationale

### Why Chrome Extension Instead of Plaid?

**Original Plan:** Plaid API for bank data  
**Pivot Reason:** UK FCA requires £40,000 capital for Open Banking access  
**New Approach:** Browser extension scrapes visible dashboards  
**Result:** 
- ✅ Works globally
- ✅ No regulatory requirements
- ✅ User controls data (privacy-friendly)
- ✅ No recurring API costs
- ✅ Can support 10+ platforms easily

### Why Client-Side PDF Generation?

**Reason:** Security and privacy  
**Approach:** PDF generated in browser using jsPDF  
**Result:** 
- ✅ No server-side data storage
- ✅ User data stays completely private
- ✅ Faster generation
- ✅ Lower hosting costs
- ✅ No data breach risk

### Why Credits System?

**Reason:** Lower barrier to entry  
**Approach:** 3 free credits on signup  
**Result:**
- ✅ Users can test product before buying
- ✅ Builds trust (see actual results first)
- ✅ Higher conversion potential
- ✅ Reduces customer acquisition friction
