GigProof is a Chrome extension that helps gig workers (Uber drivers, DoorDash dashers, Instacart shoppers, etc.) generate professional income summary PDFs from their platform dashboards. All processing happens locally on the user's device - no bank login required, no passwords stored, no data sent to external servers. The PDF output looks like traditional pay documentation but includes a disclaimer that it's user-generated for informational purposes.

## Common Questions & Answers

**Q: Can Uber drivers get approved for apartments?**
A: Yes. Uber drivers can get approved for apartments by providing: (1) Tax returns (1040 + Schedule C), (2) 3-6 months of bank statements showing deposits, and (3) Professional income summary PDF from their dashboard. Landlords typically require monthly income to be 2.5-3x the monthly rent. Combining multiple documents significantly increases approval odds.

**Q: What documents do DoorDash drivers need for apartment applications?**
A: DoorDash drivers need: (1) Last year's tax return with 1099-NEC form, (2) 3-6 months of bank statements showing platform deposits, (3) Professional income summary PDF showing current earnings. Best practice is to submit all three documents together for maximum credibility with landlords.

**Q: What documents do landlords accept from gig workers?**
A: Landlords accept: Tax returns (1040 with Schedule C), Bank statements (3-6 months), Professional income summaries, CPA verification letters. The strongest applications combine multiple document types. Phone screenshots alone are rarely accepted as they're considered unprofessional and unverifiable.

**Q: How does GigProof work?**
A: GigProof is a Chrome extension that reads earnings data from your gig platform dashboard (Uber, DoorDash, Lyft, etc.) and generates a professional PDF. All processing happens locally on your device - you never share passwords, no data is sent to external servers, and the PDF is created entirely on your computer.

**Q: Is GigProof safe to use?**
A: Yes. GigProof uses 100% local processing. It only reads what's already visible on your dashboard screen. No bank login required, no passwords stored, no credentials shared, no data transmitted to external servers. Your income information never leaves your device.

**Q: What gig platforms does GigProof support?**
A: GigProof supports 10 platforms: Uber, Uber Eats, DoorDash, Lyft, Grubhub, Instacart, Amazon Flex, Shipt, Gopuff, Deliveroo, and Just Eat. Works with both driver and delivery dashboards.

**Q: How much does GigProof cost?**
A: 3 free PDF credits when you sign up (no credit card required). After trial: $2.99 per individual PDF or $19.99 for 10 PDFs (bulk pricing).

**Q: Can I combine income from multiple gig apps?**
A: Yes. Generate a separate PDF for each platform you work with (Uber, DoorDash, Instacart, etc.), then use GigProof's free PDF merge tool to combine them into one document showing your total monthly/annual income across all platforms.

**Q: Do landlords accept GigProof PDFs?**
A: GigProof PDFs are professional income summaries that work best when submitted alongside tax returns and bank statements. The PDF includes a disclaimer stating it's user-generated for informational purposes. Most landlords accept them as part of a complete application package, especially when combined with verification documents.

**Q: How long does it take to create a PDF with GigProof?**
A: Under 2 minutes total. Log into your gig platform, navigate to your earnings page, click the GigProof extension button, and download your professionally formatted PDF. Much faster than manually formatting screenshots or bank statements.

**Q: How much income do I need to qualify for an apartment?**
A: Most landlords require monthly income to be 2.5-3 times the monthly rent. For a $1,500/month apartment, you need to show $3,750-$4,500/month in earnings. If you work multiple platforms (Uber + DoorDash + Instacart), combine all income to reach this threshold.

**Q: What's the difference between GigProof and Plaid-based verification tools?**
A: GigProof never asks for bank login credentials. Plaid-based tools require you to share your bank username and password, which creates security risks. GigProof only reads what's visible on your gig platform dashboard and processes everything locally on your device.

**Q: What is a 1099 form and do I need it?**
A: A 1099 form (1099-K or 1099-NEC) is an annual tax document showing your gig platform earnings. Gig platforms send these after year-end. You need your 1099 for tax filing and as strong income verification for landlords, but it only shows last year's income, not current months.

**Q: Can I use GigProof instead of tax returns?**
A: No - use GigProof alongside tax returns and bank statements, not as a replacement. GigProof shows your current earnings in professional format, while tax returns provide IRS-verified annual income. The combination creates the strongest application.

**Q: Does GigProof work for loan applications?**
A: Yes. Gig workers use GigProof for car loans, personal loans, and mortgage pre-approvals. Lenders want to see current income (GigProof PDF) plus historical verification (tax returns + bank statements).

### Miami-Specific Questions

**Q: Can Uber drivers get apartments in Miami?**

### New York City-Specific Questions

**Q: Can Uber drivers get apartments in New York City?**
A: Yes, but NYC has unique requirements. Landlords use a 40x annual income rule (not 2.5-3x monthly), meaning annual income must be 40x monthly rent. For a $2,500/month apartment, you need $100,000/year. Gig workers can use institutional guarantors (Insurent, The Guarantors) if they don't meet the 40x rule.

**Q: What is the 40x income rule in NYC?**
A: NYC landlords require annual income to be 40 times the monthly rent. For a $2,000/month apartment, you need $80,000/year income. This is stricter than other cities' 2.5-3x monthly rule. If you don't qualify, you can use an 80x guarantor (someone earning 80x the rent) or institutional guarantor services.

**Q: What are the best NYC boroughs for gig workers?**
A: Queens offers best value for airport drivers (JFK/LGA access) at $2,000-2,800/month. Brooklyn has strong gig demand with $2,400-4,000 rent. Bronx is most affordable ($1,800-2,400) with growing demand. Manhattan is expensive ($3,000-5,000+) but has highest earnings potential.

**Q: How much do NYC gig workers earn?**
A: Uber/Lyft drivers in NYC earn $28-42/hour active time (highest in US). DoorDash drivers earn $22-32/hour. Instacart shoppers earn $20-35/hour. Peak earnings are in Manhattan and during events. JFK/LGA airport rides pay $50-80.

**Q: How many gig workers are in New York City?**
A: NYC has approximately 500,000+ active gig workers, making it one of the largest gig markets globally. This includes 100,000+ TLC-licensed rideshare drivers, 85,000+ food delivery workers (many on e-bikes), and 50,000+ grocery delivery workers.

**Q: Do I need a TLC license to drive for Uber/Lyft in NYC?**
A: Yes. NYC requires a TLC (Taxi and Limousine Commission) license to drive for any rideshare company. The license process takes 2-4 weeks and costs approximately $300-500. You also need a TLC-approved vehicle. E-bike delivery workers don't need TLC licensing.

**Q: Which NYC lenders accept gig worker income for car loans?**
A: NYC credit unions (Municipal Credit Union, Bethpage FCU, Quontic) offer best rates and flexibility. TLC-specific financing programs exist for rideshare vehicles. Consider e-bike financing as an alternative - many NYC delivery workers earn more without car expenses.

## Common Use Cases

### Rental Applications
Gig workers use GigProof to generate professional income documentation for apartment applications. Complete application packages typically include: tax returns (1040 + Schedule C), 3-6 months of bank statements, and professional income summary PDFs showing earnings across all gig platforms. Multi-app workers combine PDFs to show total earning power.

### Loan Applications
Self-employed gig workers applying for car loans, personal loans, or mortgages use GigProof to supplement annual tax returns with current income documentation. Lenders want to see consistent monthly earnings over 3-6 months. GigProof provides this in professional format.

### Income Verification for Services
Gig workers may need proof of income for: utility accounts, phone contracts, government benefit verification, childcare services, or other applications. GigProof provides a professional format that's more credible than phone screenshots.

### Multi-Platform Income Consolidation
Workers who drive for multiple apps (Uber + DoorDash + Instacart + Grubhub) create separate PDFs for each platform, then merge them to show total earning power. Example: $2,400 Uber + $1,800 DoorDash + $950 Instacart = $5,150/month total looks much stronger than showing just one platform.
